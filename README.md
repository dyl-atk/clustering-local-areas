### Clustering local areas with census data
## Data science professional practice project

## Executive summary

This paper explains an approach to using k-means clustering to group local areas into similar categories using census data.
The model considers six themes: age, population density, health, education, economy and employment. Each was given equal weighting. Data across these themes was collected from the 2021 census for England and Wales. Each parliamentary constituency in England and Wales was assigned into one of five clusters based on these characteristics.
These clusters identify areas with similar social and economic characteristics across the country. These results could be used for a variety of purposes. These include identifying areas where government investment is most required, businesses selecting locations to expand their business or prospective home movers understanding more about the area they plan to move to. 
This clustering framework could be built upon for more detailed analysis. This could include looking at more granular local areas, such as electoral wards. The number of clusters could be increased above five to understand localities in more detail.
